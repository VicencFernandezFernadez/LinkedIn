# Computational physics
This directory contains some projects of Computational physics made by me during the subject "FÃ­sica Computacional". You can find:

1. Interpolation and roots of functions.
2. Numerical integration.
3. Random numbers and MonteCarlo integration.
4. Ordinary differential equations.
5. Differential equations in partial derivatives.
