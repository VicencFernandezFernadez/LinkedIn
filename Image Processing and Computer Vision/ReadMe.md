# Image Processing and Computer Vision
This directory contains some of my projects in Image Processing and Computer Vision. This directory is in process to be filled in, as I am now coursing this subject, with topics:
1. Basic image manipulation operations
2. Intensity transformations: contrast changes, histogram and equalization.
3. Fourier transform. 
4. Segmentation and clustering: k-means.
6. Classification: k nearest neighbors (kNN). Support Vector Machines (SVM).
